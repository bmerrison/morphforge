Setting up and Running Morphforge
=================================

.. warning::

    As of April 2012; morphforge is **currently undergoing major API 
    changes**! Although the package is unlikely to change conceptually, 
    please be aware that **class/method/parameter/package names
    will probably change from commit-to-commit**, as the package is tidied!
    
.. warning:: 

    **Use as your own risk!** This package is provided as-is and should
    currently be considered *alpha* quality! **There may be bugs- 
    you have been warned!** I hope there are relatively few, but it is a large 
    piece of code; which I have developed informally alongside my Ph.D. 
    Please contribute any tests you write to improve the testsuite!

    
    
.. note::

    Otherwise, enjoy morphforge! 
    Please contribute useful functions you have written, any example scripts, ideas for improving the documentation
    or general feedback about using it.
